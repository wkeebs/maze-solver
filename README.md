# Maze Solver ðŸ§ 

A maze solver written in `Python` with `TKinter`.

Randomly generates a maze, renders it and finds a path through it using graph traversal algorithms.

Currently utilises a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve the maze, rendering the path as it is computed to highlight the backtracking and space for optimisation.
